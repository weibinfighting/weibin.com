This is Qu Weibin's personal homepage. I am currently a data analyst at a public welfare organization. My focus is on the study of mathematics and statistics, and in my less serious moments, I enjoy reading classical Chinese literature and poetry. I have self-studied almost all statistical software, but have now largely forgotten it. I am a loyal fan of open-source software, and since learning the basics of web scraping, I often take matters into my own hands when something interests me, ensuring self-sufficiency. I am a typical idealist, who likes to tinker without any particular purpose, and my current research focuses on data visualization and social statistics. Despite not having much natural talent for mathematics, I always like to blindly persevere, pushing through even when it's tough, with no idea what the final outcome will be. I read little during my school years, but developed a fascination for poetry from junior high onwards. Later, I dabbled in literature from various countries, but only briefly in each case.
I am curious about new things and are willing to work hard for things that interest me.
